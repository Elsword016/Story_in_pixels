## TidyTuesday in Python

  - TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project where users bring their data or at times the data is given and analyzed in **R**.
  - The R4DS Online Learning Community organizes it. Join their [Slack](https://r4ds.io/join)) for free online help with R and other data-related topics, or to participate in data-related book clubs.

**My goal with this repository is to try to implement their way of analysis into Python**. 

Some of the analyses are good and I think as a learner it is a nice way to learn better data representation while at the same time practicing and improving EDA skills on varied datasets.
