## Story in Pixels

A fancy way to tell that this repository is a showcase and so learning progress to analyze data. Not only analyzing but also able to tell a comprehensive story along with it. 

Most of the datasets are from public repositories. This repository focuses on EDA, feature engineering, data modeling, and ML algorithms to fit the data. I won't focus too much on optimizing the model performances (I'm GPU-poor).
