## Story in Pixels

A fancy way to tell that this repository is a showcase and so learning progress to analyze data. Not only analyzing but also able to tell a comprehensive story along with it. 

Datasets won't be specific to a domain such a medical.

Most of the datasets are from public repositories. This repository focuses on EDA, feature engineering, data modeling, and ML algorithms to fit the data. I won't focus too much on optimizing the model performances (I'm GPU-poor).

## 1. Taylor Swift Lyrics data 
The aim of this analysis is to have a more in dept look at her discography and songwriting, with a special attention to the results achieved in terms of Spotify streams and pure sales. It also features an [Streamlit Dashboard](https://storyinpixels-taylorswift.streamlit.app/) to have a better visualization of the key features of the data.

The datasets used are all from Kaggle.
