## Story in Pixels

A fancy way to tell that this repository is a showcase and so learning progress to analyze data. Not only analyzing but also able to tell a comprehensive story along with it. 

Datasets won't be specific to a domain such a medical.

Most of the datasets are from public repositories. This repository focuses on EDA, feature engineering, data modeling, and ML algorithms to fit the data. I won't focus too much on optimizing the model performances (I'm GPU-poor).

## 1. Taylor Swift Lyrics data 
The aim of this analysis is to have a more in dept look at her discography and songwriting, with a special attention to the results achieved in terms of Spotify streams and pure sales. It also features an [Streamlit Dashboard](https://storyinpixels-taylorswift.streamlit.app/) to have a better visualization of the key features of the data.

The datasets used are all from Kaggle. Additionally, I processed the data and fine-tuned the latest [Gemma-2b](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs) model from Google to generate lyrics similar in style. It also comes with a gradio interface.

## 2. General Trends in Artificial Intelligence
This analysis aims to understand the recent trends in AI, in terms of models' performances, costs to train, corporate investments, etc.
